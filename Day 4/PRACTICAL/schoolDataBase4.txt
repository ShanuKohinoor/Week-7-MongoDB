Tasks:
    1. Use the same school database.
    2. Data Modeling:
          2a. Create two collections, students and courses.
          2b. Show one example of embedding (store course details inside a student).
          2c. Show one example of referencing (store only courseId in the student).
    3. Indexing:
          3a. Create a single-field index on course.
          3b. Create a compound index on { course: 1, totalMarks: -1 }.
          3c. Create a text index on subjects and search for “Math”.
    4. Performance:
           • Run one query with and without index; compare the result using explain("executionStats").
